"# BalexCompany" 
The Employee Pay Calculation Program is designed for BalexInfoTech (U) Ltd to compute the weekly earnings of hourly employees based on specific rules set by the US Department of Labour and the State of Massachusetts. The program ensures that employees are compensated fairly according to their hours worked and the legal requirements.
Key Features:

    Basic Pay Calculation: The program calculates the total pay for employees based on their hourly rate and the number of hours worked in a week.
    Overtime Compensation: Employees who work more than 40 hours in a week are paid at 1.5 times their base pay for each hour over 40.
    Minimum Wage Compliance: The program checks that the base pay meets the minimum wage requirement of $8.00 per hour. If the base pay is below this threshold, the program outputs an error message.
    Maximum Hours Restriction: The program ensures that employees do not work more than 60 hours per week. If this limit is exceeded, an error message is displayed.

How It Works:

    The program is implemented in Java within a class named BalexCompany.
    It includes a method that takes basePay and hoursWorked as input parameters.
    The method checks for compliance with wage and hour regulations, calculates regular and overtime pay, and then prints the total earnings or relevant error messages.
    A main method is included to demonstrate the functionality by testing various scenarios with different employee data.

This program ensures that BalexInfoTech (U) Ltd remains compliant with labor laws while fairly compensating its hourly employees.
